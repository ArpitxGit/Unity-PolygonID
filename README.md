#### Notes:

Each script corresponds to a specific functionality, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
Utilize events or delegates for communication between components to maintain loose coupling.
Error handling and UI feedback should be implemented for a seamless user experience.
Implement proper state management and session handling as per the app's requirements.
This layout provides a structured foundation for integrating Polygon ID features into a Unity app. Actual implementation would involve coding the functionalities within each script, integrating Polygon ID SDK functionalities where needed, and ensuring proper communication between components and scenes.
